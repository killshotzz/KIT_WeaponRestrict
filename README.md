We create our codes with <3

The installation is simple.
Drag and drop the files to your servers.
After that you can change map / restart server / load the plugin with the console.

If the plugin has a MySQL connection, then you can set a Database Entry and Table Prefix in the plugin's cfg (Inside our folder: cfg/Kitsune/).
If you are beginner user in server configuration then here is our installation guide:

1. Drag and drop the main folder from the compressed file to your server's main library (inside csgo/)
2. If the plugin has a Database connection open the database cfg inside your sourcemod/configs/ folder and add (if not exists already) a new entry with the name of "kitsune")
3. Change the map to something else
(Some of our plugin use extensions. That means a map change won't load the plugin correctly so you have to restart the server to load the extension too.)
